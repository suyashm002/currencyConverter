# CurrencyConverter
CurrencyConverter is an Android application for converting currency rates using MVVM architecture, Room database, ViewModels, and test cases. This app provides offline currency rates for seamless conversions even without an active internet connection.

## Features
- **Currency Conversion**: Convert between different currencies using the latest available exchange rates.

- **Offline Mode**: Automatically switches to offline mode when the internet is not available, allowing for currency conversions using cached data.
- **MVVM Architecture**: The app follows the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture to maintain a clean separation between the UI and the underlying data layers.
- **Room Database**: Used for local storage of currency exchange rates to enable offline access and persistence.
- **LiveData**: Ensures efficient and responsive UI updates whenever the currency data changes.
- **Hilt Dependency Injection**: Hilt is used for dependency injection to simplify the appâ€™s architecture.
- **Unit Testing**: Includes unit tests to ensure the functionality of ViewModels, repositories, and other components.
